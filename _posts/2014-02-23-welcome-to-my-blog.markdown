## Here's what to expect.


Welcome to my new website and blog!  My name is Ben Wells and I am a Web developer, musician, and overall solver-of-problems. I am located in Charleston, SC. 


This site can be thought of as my _home base_. I hope to use this space to keep the internets updated with all that I am working on and learning as I grow as a web developer, musician, and overall human being.


### What about this site? What did you use to build it?


I am hosting this site using the fabulous [Github Pages][gpages]. It is built and powered by the amazing [Jekyll][jk] "text transformation" engine. I have done a good deal of Ruby development in _Rails_ and _Sinatra_ in the past, but this is my first time digging into the Jekyll framework. I must say that, so far, I am incredibly impressed with how quickly I could get a well-structured and easily maintainable website up-and-running. 

Great work to all those who make Jekyll possible!

As I continue to work on this site, I will post more about some of the cool thing I learn as I go!

####Other technologies used in the making of this blog so far:

* [jQuery][jq]
* [Bootstrap 3][bootstrap]
* [Font Awesome][fontawesome]
* CSS Animation Libraries by
  - [Justin Aguilar][justinaguilar]
  - [Ian Lunn][ianlunn]

More to come, soon!<br><br>
Cheers,<br>
Ben
