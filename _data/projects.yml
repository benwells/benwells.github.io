  description: |
    An excuse to practice working with React JS, I added a weather app to my admin site that lets logged-in users
    add/remove Locations, save locations for later, and select a location to view the weather for that location.
    I am working on a design for a full-fledged weather dashboard that I will be implementing soon.

  subtitle: Website for navontherapy.com with custom CMS functionality.
  description: |
    For navontherapy.com,  I wanted a simple, fully-responsive design for a small business
    website. The added challenge of building this site was a custom CMS system that allows
    the client to login as a site administrator and customize all content.  For the CMS/authentication system,
    I built it from the ground up using a node.js express application and Mongo DB as the database.

    I have a lot of plans for this site, which is why Rails was chosen as the stack.
    So far it's a single page static site, but I will be adding more dynamic content,
    a calendar, and streaming music this year.

  subtitle: A simple HTML5 canvas game
  description: |
    I really wanted an excuse to play around with JavaScript's prototypical
    inheritence, and simultaneously wanted to see if I could build a game.  Simple,
    crude, and never-ending, but this is what I came up with!

  subtitle: Designed to get me up and running quickly.
  description: |
    Taking a queue from Yeoman, I wanted to start my own "new project template" using tools
    that I utilize in my projects on a daily basis.  I hope to cut down significantly on the
    "grunt work" (no pun intended) required to get a new project off the ground.  I will be
    adding to this template repo as I work, adding new tools on a regular basis.  I hope to
    one day turn this baby into a Yeoman generator as well!

    Built as an exercise in Object Oriented JavaScript, this

    Shake your device to choose a random song, and choose a feel or time signature to allow
    for some potentially unusual song choices.

  subtitle: A silly little angular game
  description: |
    The goal of this little app was working under time constraints.  With only a certain amount of
    time to code one day, I wanted to design and build an app within the time constraints that I had.
    I was also looking for an excuse to play around with CSS animations.
