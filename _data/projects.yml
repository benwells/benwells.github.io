    Built as an exercise in Object Oriented JavaScript, this
    little application helps jazz musicians answer the question "What should we play?".
    Shake your device to choose a random song, and choose a feel or time signature to allow
    for some potentially unusual song choices.

    Taking a queue from Yeoman, I wanted to start my own "new project template" using tools
    that I utilize in my projects on a daily basis.  I hope to cut down significantly on the
    "grunt work" (no pun intended) required to get a new project off the ground.  I will be
    adding to this template repo as I work, adding new tools on a regular basis.  I hope to
    one day turn this baby into a Yeoman generator as well!
