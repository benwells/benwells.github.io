  subtitle: A automatic tunepicker for jazz standards.

    Built as an exercise in Object Oriented JavaScript, this
    little application helps jazz musicians answer the question "What should we play?".
    Shake your device to choose a random song, and choose a feel or time signature to allow
    for some potentially unusual song choices.
