    For navontherapy.com,  I wanted a simple, fully-responsive design for a small business
    website. The added challenge of building this site was a custom CMS system that allows
    the client to login as a site administrator and customize all content.  For the CMS/authentication system,
    I built it from the ground up using a node.js express application and Mongo DB as the database.

    Taking a queue from Yeoman, I wanted to start my own "new project template" using tools
    that I utilize in my projects on a daily basis.  I hope to cut down significantly on the
    "grunt work" (no pun intended) required to get a new project off the ground.  I will be
    adding to this template repo as I work, adding new tools on a regular basis.  I hope to
    one day turn this baby into a Yeoman generator as well!

  subtitle: A automatic tunepicker for jazz standards.

    Built as an exercise in Object Oriented JavaScript, this
    little application helps jazz musicians answer the question "What should we play?".
    Shake your device to choose a random song, and choose a feel or time signature to allow
    for some potentially unusual song choices.
